Key Promoter Plugin (Fork)
==========================

This is a fork of the Key Promoter plugin for IntelliJ Idea. The original source code can be found at https://code.google.com/p/key-promoter/

The Key Promoter Plugin is intended to show hints when using the mouse for something that can be done with a keyboard shortcut.

Additional Features / Modifications
-----------------------------------
* Statistics are persisted and thereby not deleted when closing the IDE.
* A top ten missed shortcuts window is added to the IDE. Thereby, it is more obvious which shortcut combinations are worth learning for you to increase your personal efficiency.
* A button that resets your statistics. 
* Support for up-to-date IntelliJ versions.
